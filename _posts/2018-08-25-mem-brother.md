# 九月九日忆山东兄弟 <sub>王维</sub>
# Recalling my brothers in Shandong on the Ninth of September


独在异乡为异客,    Alone in a different country, among different people,

每逢佳节倍思亲。   I think of my family during every festivity. 

遥知兄弟登高处,    Learned that my brothers are climbing the Tai mountain,

遍插茱萸少一人。   They are wearing veils of flowers, but seem to be missing one.
